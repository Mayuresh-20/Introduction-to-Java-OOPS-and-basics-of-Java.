What is JAVA?
--> Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!

Java Features Java Paradigms:

►Simple:

Java is a simple language.Java is a simple language.
Java is a simple syntax, clean and easy to understand.

►Object Oriented
Java is truly Object Oriented language.
All programs in Java are managed with classes and objects.

►Robust:

Java programs have robust nature as Java provides automatic garbage collection for unused objects and also provides appropriate ways of exception handling which would prevent the system from crashing.

Character Set:

► Java supports Unicode character set which is a standard that supports all the international characters of various languages. 
► These characters denote any alphabet, digit or special symbols. 
► ASCII is a subset of Unicode Character set.
► ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange

*/class H1 { public static void main(String args[]) { System.out.println("Hello World"); 
} 
}
Platform Independent (Architecture Neutral) and Portable:

o Java programs are Platform Independent i.e. they can be easily moved from one computer system to another. 
o Java achieves architecture neutrality because Java compiler produces an intermediate code known as bytecode for a machine that does not exist. The machine specific code is generated by the
Java interpreter or JIT Compiler.

Java supports multithreaded programming, which allows us to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. o Due to this facility, we need not wait for application to finish one task before beginning another an

Multithreaded:

► High Performance: Java provides Just in Time Compiler which is built into the JVM. JIT complier reads the bytecodes into sections and compiles them to the machine language so that the program can run faster and thus high performance is obtained.

► Secure:

JVM can keep a watch on what program is doing. If the program is doing some questionable things such as writing into a file then JVM can prevent it.

► Distributed:

Java is designed for the distributed environment of the Internet,

because it handles TCP/IP protocol @ Java applications can access remote objects and procedures on

Internet enabling both the data and programs to be distributed and shared on Internet

► Dynamic:

Java is a dynamic language i.e. it is capable of linking new class libranes, methods and objects The linking depends on the runtime query and the responses of user Le whether to execute a particular code or to abort the
process.
